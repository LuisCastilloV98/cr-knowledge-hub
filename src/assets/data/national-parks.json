  "longDescription": "Costa Rica is home to an extraordinary National System of Conservation Areas that protects an incredible diversity of ecosystems and unique species found nowhere else in the world. From majestic volcanoes like Arenal, Po√°s, Iraz√∫, and Rinc√≥n de la Vieja, to the mystical cloud forests of Monteverde and Santa Elena, the country is a true natural sanctuary. Its national parks, such as Manuel Antonio, Corcovado, Tortuguero, and Cahuita, shelter an astonishing variety of wildlife, including monkeys, jaguars, sloths, sea turtles, and exotic birds. Marine reserves like Marino Ballena and Coco Island protect coral reefs, mangroves, and endangered marine species. This extensive system not only promotes scientific research and environmental education but also drives sustainable ecotourism, encouraging the conservation of biodiversity and respect for natural resources.",
