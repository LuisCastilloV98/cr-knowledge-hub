  "longDescription": "Costa Rica is home to eight officially recognized indigenous groups: Boruca, Bribri, Cab√©car, Maleku, Huetar, Chorotega, Teribe (T√©rraba), and Ng√§be. Each community has preserved a unique cultural identity through art, ritual, and craftsmanship. Their creations‚Äîwooden masks, ritual dances, woven baskets, textiles, ceramics, music, and oral storytelling‚Äîreflect not only aesthetic skill but also cosmology, spirituality, and social life. Art has served as a medium of resilience against colonization, a way to transmit knowledge between generations, and a bridge between humans and nature. From the famous Boruca ‚ÄòDance of the Little Devils‚Äô to the sophisticated Chorotega pottery and the sacred Bribri weaving traditions, Costa Rican indigenous art represents a living heritage that continues to inspire both local communities and visitors worldwide.",
